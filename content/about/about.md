I am a young applied computer science student with a passion for elegant
code and create that which does not yet exist. In my spare time I experiment
with the latest technologies. In all areas: AI, system administration, web development and
new languages like Rust. I am always looking for new ways to improve my
speed up workflow. For relaxation I am also very busy with sports and music.
